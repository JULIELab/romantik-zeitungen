Romantik-Zeitungen

Welcome to Romantik-Zeitungen

*Romantik-Zeitungen* is the gateway to a full-text searchable corpus of digitized historical newspapers from the era of German romanticism. It has been set up by researchers from the Graduate School "Romanticism as a Model" (http://modellromantik.uni-jena.de/) and JULIE Lab (https://julielab.de) at Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena, Germany.

Currently you can search and access complete content for the *Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung* (General Music Gazette, AMZ) which was published between 1798 and 1865 in Leipzig. It contains 26,390 pages of 53 volumes in total. *AMZ* is not only the most important periodical of music criticism of German romanticism, but also a very important text resource for literary studies. For example, E.T.A. Hoffmannâ€™s story *Ritter Gluck* was published on Feb 15, 1809 for the first time in AMZ (link).

We are indebted to the Bavarian State Library (https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/title/BV002720696) and the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) for making their digital resources accessible as well as to the Open Online Newspaper Initiative (Open ONI, https://open-oni.github.io/) for developing the open source web application which is used to build this site.
